-- This is a part of research paper written by Sohoon Youn guided by Dr.Ryan Browne at the University of Waterloo

The finite mixture of multivariate leptokurtic-normal distributions is a flexible model based on
mixtures of elliptical heavy-tailed distributions. However, the modelâ€™s large number of parameters
for estimation becomes computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional data. To address
this issue, two procedures for the covariance structure are proposed. The first approach is
based on the factor analyzers, while the second is based on a high-dimensional data clustering.
Each methodology will be demonstrated with numerical experiments.
